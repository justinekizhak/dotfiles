* Introduction

They say your dotfiles will most likely be the longest project you ever work on.
So for this reason, your dotfiles must be organized in a disciplined manner for
maintainability and extensibility.

My dotfiles are the direct reflection of my software development workflow and
practices of my past 3 years.

My dotfiles have undergone many transformation from single file vimrc to
forking someone else's to building a simple yet sophisticated structure for
housing more dotfiles.

One thing you may notice is that my workflow consists of diverse toolkit,
this makes it for easier adoption and exploration.

- Emacs
    - Spacemacs
