* Introduction

They say your dotfiles will most likely be the longest project you ever work on.
So for this reason, your dotfiles must be organized in a disciplined manner for
maintainability and extensibility.

My dotfiles are the direct reflection of my software development workflow and
practices of my past 3 years.

My dotfiles have undergone many transformation from single file vimrc to
forking someone else's to building a simple yet sophisticated structure for
housing more dotfiles.

One thing you may notice is that my workflow consists of diverse toolkit,
this makes it for easier adoption and exploration.

* Features

Contains settings for

- Emacs
  - Doom emacs
  - Spacemacs
- Vim
- Zsh
  - Zim framework
- Tmux
- Custom bash scripts
- Fonts
- VSCode (only install instructions for dotfiles)
- and some terminal settings

* Getting started

1. ~git clone https://gitlab.com/justinekizhak/dotfiles~
2. All the instructions are in =devfile.toml=. Use [[https://gitlab.com/devinstaller/devinstaller][devinstaller]] for installing
   the packages

* Documentation

Each application has their own documentation in their folders.

| Application | Documentation path                                                   |

** Repository mirroring

~Gitlab -> Github~ repository mirroring.

My main config lives in Gitlab, but I do maintain a mirror at Github.

The mirroring is done automatically by Gitlab. All I have to do it just keep on
pushing commits onto Gitlab.

So here is how to setup the mirroring:

*** Step1: Create Github personal token

Instructions [[https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token]]

*** Step2: Mirroring from Gitlab -> Github

Instructions: [[http://repositories.compbio.cs.cmu.edu/help/workflow/repository_mirroring.md#setting-up-a-mirror-from-gitlab-to-github]]

Make sure to add token in both the URL and in the =password= textfield.
